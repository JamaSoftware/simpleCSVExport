## Simple CSV Exporter
```verifier.py``` is a script which exports all project information, items for each item type, project relationships, and project comments to csv files for a given Jama instance using the Jama REST API.  

Please note that this script is distrubuted as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.  This example omits error checking. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the script.
